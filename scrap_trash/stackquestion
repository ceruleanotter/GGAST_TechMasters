Hello, I'm new to Pinax and Django. I'm trying to extend the Pinax profile by having a OneToOneField that pulls from another app I installed  (in this case, django-swingtime ()). I've got everything to show up in the admin interface, but I cannot add new Users. I get the following error:

IntegrityError at /admin/auth/user/add/

profiles_profile.event_type_id may not be NULL

Request Method: 	POST
Request URL: 	http://localhost:8000/admin/auth/user/add/
Django Version: 	1.3.1
Exception Type: 	IntegrityError
Exception Value: 	

profiles_profile.event_type_id may not be NULL

event_type is a model from swingtime. I get this error whether I'm trying to add a User from anywhere within the Django admin.

Here's the my Profiles/models.py (changed lines are bolded)

from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

from idios.models import ProfileBase

from swingtime.models import EventType

class Profile(ProfileBase):
    name = models.CharField(_("name"), max_length=50, null=True, blank=True)
    about = models.TextField(_("about"), null=True, blank=True)
    location = models.CharField(_("location"), max_length=40, null=True, blank=True)
    website = models.URLField(_("website"), null=True, blank=True, verify_exists=False)
    event_type = models.OneToOneField(EventType)

    def __unicode__(self):
        return "Name: %s -- %s" % (self.name, self.about)

Perhaps if someone could explain the relationship between accounts, profiles, and users and what files are OK to edit and which ones are inadvisable to edit (for instance, I don't think I want to be changing anything around in my Pinax site packages...), I can make some progress. Also, I assume this idios plugin is involved in the proccess, but none of the links to documentatin I've found will load ().

Thank you!
